# Backend developer test

Hey, Back-End developer. Welcome.

Your company is growing and now you must register a property inventory! Your application must support GET, PUT, POST and DELETE of products and users. Ah, your CFO wants to know when to buy new products and which ones he needs to sell when it achieves 3 years of use.

> **Hey, this is important!** We hope you can spend about 16 hours on this project. If you can finish fester -- great! If not, limit yourself and don't spend much longer then 24 hours MAX.

To create the application you can use any of these technologies:

- PHP (5.6 / 7.2)
- NodeJS
- Lavavel, Express.JS, Socket.IO
-  MySql, MariaDB, Redis

## Must Have Requirements

- A README explaining how to RUN and USE the project
- Must have a RESTFUL API
- Must be a CRUD application
- Project structure
- Register page
- Login page

## Nice to have

- Some Tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc)
- Data modelling schema
- Security modules, like JWT
- Deployed code
- Deployment instructions
- Even if you are not a frontend developer, it would be nice to have some screens ;-P
- Custom design like the logo and banners, do not forget to send us the original file (psd, ai, etc)
- Anything else you would like to add

## When you are finished

- Please send your solution as a github repository link to tech.challenge@hubchain.com
- also please don't fork this repo as other candidates could then start build on top of your solution ;-)

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code Quality
- Performance
- Security
- User Experience
- Test coverage
